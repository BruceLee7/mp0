  <p class="bio">
    I'm a new MCS student at UIUC. I graduated from Nanyang Technological University in Singapore with a major in Computer Science. 
    I'm happy to join the class of CS 409. I would like to learn more about full stack development and improve my programming skills.
    In my free time, I enjoy sports and poker games. Hope everyone is doing well and looking forward to a great semester!
